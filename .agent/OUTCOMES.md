# Outcome Ledger

## OUTCOME-SENTRY-AUTHORITY-BOOTSTRAP-001 — Directive SENTRY-AUTHORITY-BOOTSTRAP-001
- Completed: 2026-08-24
- Verdict: COMPLETE
- Retrieval confidence: ADEQUATE
- Evidence level: E3_TARGET_TESTED
- Git state / commit: Final governance commit recorded in the GitHub handoff and Notion update.

### Technical state discovered
The restored `main` checkout was clean at baseline `63376fe` and contained only the pre-Authority documentation-first SENTRY repository. GitHub and Notion agree on the project goal, V0.1 office boundary, M0 gate, DAWN evaluation, Miloco reference-only status, and absence of runtime implementation.

### Work performed
Installed the canonical Authority 3.0 root router, project-state/history structure, reusable workflow and references, SENTRY-specific state records, and a completed governance task packet. No product/runtime implementation was added.

### Acceptance results
- Canonical Authority 3.0 structure installed: PASSED
- Root `AGENTS.md` is the Authority router: PASSED
- `.agent/` state is SENTRY-specific and identifies M0: PASSED
- `.agents/` workflow/reference paths resolve: PASSED
- Existing SENTRY documentation preserved: PASSED
- No runtime implementation or dependencies introduced: PASSED
- Commit and push to GitHub: PASSED
- Notion evidence update: PASSED

### Validation
- Expected Authority tree exists: PASSED
- Root router references real mandatory paths: PASSED
- `.agent/INDEX.md` references real mandatory state files: PASSED
- Required workflow/reference files exist: PASSED
- SENTRY-specific goal/scope/current-state content present: PASSED
- Governance-only placeholder scan: PASSED
- Final diff limited to governance/state files: PASSED
- Final working tree clean after commit: PASSED

### Assumptions confirmed
- SENTRY was documentation-first and implementation had not begun.
- M0 — Bootstrap + DAWN Integration Feasibility is the current authorized gate.
- DAWN is the preferred foundation under evaluation; Miloco is architectural reference only.

### Assumptions disproven
- None.

### Risks / blockers
- DAWN integration behavior remains unverified and is intentionally deferred to M0.

### Architect decision required
YES — review and accept this governance result before authorizing M0 implementation.
